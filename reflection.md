Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think it's really cool and impressive that you can just extend a parent class and create subclasses with new features. It's super neat and saves a lot of time becuase now I don't have to rewrite a whole bunch of code, I can just reuse code from a parent class and tweak it to fit the needs of the subclasses.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think what worked was starting this assignment early and working on it piece by piece throughout the week. I like taking on a new subclass for every day of the week. For instance, I'll start with the building file on Thursday, the house class on friday, the library class on saturday, and the cafe class on sunday. When Monday comes, I can ask questions in class or go to office hours/TA hours. Then from Monday-Wednesday I just revise me code and make sure everything looks good. This also leaves me extra time just in case i run into some bugs, I still have a few days to make sure everything is running smoothly before it is due on Wednesday. I advise students to split up their work like this if they were to take this class.
